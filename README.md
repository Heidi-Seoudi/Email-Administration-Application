# Email Administration Application (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based Email Administration Service** designed to simulate the creation and management of company email accounts for employees.  
It focuses on applying **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles while handling common email system tasks.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice Java OOP concepts
- Create and manage employee email accounts
- Generate secure random passwords
- Assign departments dynamically
- Structure a real-world style Java application

---

## 🧱 Application Structure

The application consists of two main classes:

- **`EmailApp`**
  - Contains the `main` method
  - Serves as the entry point of the application
  - Creates and manages `Email` objects

- **`Email`**
  - Handles all email-related logic
  - Stores employee information
  - Generates passwords
  - Builds company email addresses

## ✨ Core Features

- **Department Selection**
  - Users select a department via console input
  - Departments affect the email address format

- **Automatic Email Generation**
  - Email format:  
    ```
    firstname.lastname@department.company.com
    ```

- **Random Password Generation**
  - Configurable password length
  - Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols

- **Mailbox Management**
  - Customizable mailbox capacity
  - Supports alternate email addresses
